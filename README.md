# Fuzzy Matching Made Fun (and Functional!)

## Overview

Welcome to the world of **fuzzy matching**, where names get scrubbed, massaged, and compared to find their long-lost twins (or at least their closest lookalikes). This Python script helps match names between two CSV files, using both **exact** and **fuzzy** matching techniques, so you can spot similaritiesâ€”even when typos or formatting quirks try to get in the way!

## Setup

Before you dive into the wonderful world of near-identical text, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```
2. **Activate your virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
   ```

Now you're ready to rock and roll!

## Running the Script

Once set up, you can run the script like this:

```bash
python fuzzyMatch.py ~/Downloads/Matching\ Directory\ Combined\ -\ EP.csv 0 ~/Downloads/BankBillPayFile.csv 0
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:
- The first argument is the **first CSV file**.
- The second argument is the **column index** (zero-based) to match from that file.
- The third argument is the **second CSV file**.
- The fourth argument is the **column index** (zero-based) to match from that file.

## Whatâ€™s Under the Hood?

### The Magic Formula (aka How It Works)

1. **Read CSV files**: We load the given column from each CSV and store it as a key-value pair, where the key is a cleaned-up version of the name.
2. **Exact Matching**: We check for names that match exactly across both files.
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: When exact matching fails, we use **Levenshtein distance** (via `fuzzywuzzy`) to find similar names.
4. **Export the results**: The script writes a `matches.csv` file containing:
   - Exact matches
   - Fuzzy matches with a similarity score

### The Cleanup Crew (aka Preprocessing)

Before comparing, names are **cleaned up** by:
- Removing **punctuation**
- Stripping **trailing digits** (because who needs those?)
- Converting to **lowercase**
- Removing **spaces**

### What Youâ€™ll See in the Output

The script will proudly announce:
- The number of items in each file
- How many exact matches were found
- How many near-matches were discovered
- A final *victory message* when the matching is done!

## Example Output

```plaintext
File 1 has  150  items.
File 2 has  120  items.
Great news! We found 75 exact matches.
Bad news :( We found 30 in file2 that are not in file1 and still have 45 to compare against.
We have 20 fuzzy matches.
Done, check the output file.
```

## Things to Keep in Mind

- **Higher scores (out of 100) mean better matches**.
- If the top match has a score <90, we add a few empty placeholders to visually separate weaker suggestions.
- The fuzzy matching threshold is set at **65**, so anything below that is ignored (we donâ€™t want garbage matches!).

## Wrapping Up

With this script, you can now:

âœ… Identify duplicate or nearly identical names across two CSV files.
âœ… Catch those sneaky variations in spelling and formatting.
âœ… Save tons of time instead of manually comparing files.

Go forth and match like a pro! ðŸŽ¯
